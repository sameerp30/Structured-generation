standard input for the command is the empty file dev null Otherwise the environment for the execution of a command contains the file descriptors of the invoking shell as modified by input output specifications Prompting When used interactively the shell prompts with the value of PS1 after expanding it for parameter expansion command substitution and arithmetic substitution before reading a command In addition each single in the prompt is replaced by the command number A is required to place in the prompt If at any time a new-line is typed and further input is needed to complete a command then the secondary prompt i e the value of PS2 is issued † name arg If name is a function defined with the function name reserved word syntax the function is executed in the current environment as if it had been defined with the name syntax Otherwise if name refers to a file the file is read in its entirety and the commands are executed in the current shell environment The search path specified by PATH is used to find the directory containing the file If any arguments arg are given they become the positional parameters while processing the command and the original positional parameters are restored upon completion Otherwise the positional parameters are unchanged The exit status is the exit status of the last command executed Zsh is a UNIX command interpreter shell usable as an interactive login shell and as a shell script command processor Of the standard shells zsh most closely resembles ksh but includes many enhancements It does not provide compatibility with POSIX or other shells in its default operating mode see the section Compatibility below The shell learns immediately whenever a job changes state Normally bash waits until it is about to print a prompt before reporting changes in a job s status so as to not interrupt any other output If the -b option to the set builtin command is enabled bash reports such changes immediately Any trap on SIGCHLD is executed for each child that exits _ At shell startup set to the pathname used to invoke the shell or shell script being executed as passed in the environment or argument list Subsequently expands to the last argument to the previous simple command executed in the foreground after expansion Also set to the full pathname used to invoke each command executed and placed in the environment exported to that command When checking mail this parameter holds the name of the mail file currently being checked BASH Expands to the full filename used to invoke this instance of bash BASHOPTS A colon-separated

reported as on by shopt If this variable is in the environment when bash starts up each shell option in the list will be enabled before reading any startup files This variable is read-only BASHPID Expands to the process ID of the current bash process This differs from under certain circumstances such as subshells that do not require bash to be re-initialized Assignments to BASHPID have no effect If BASHPID is unset it loses its special properties even if it is subsequently reset BASH_ALIASES An associative array variable whose members correspond to the internal list of aliases as

call stack The number of parameters to the current subroutine shell function or script executed with or source is at the top of the stack When a subroutine is executed the number of parameters passed is pushed onto BASH_ARGC The shell sets BASH_ARGC only when in extended debugging mode see the description of the extdebug option to the shopt builtin below Setting extdebug after the shell has started to execute a script or referencing this variable when extdebug is not set may result in inconsistent values BASH_ARGV An array variable containing all of the parameters in the current bash execution call stack The final parameter of the last subroutine call is at the top of the stack the first parameter of the initial call is at the bottom When a subroutine is executed the parameters supplied are pushed onto BASH_ARGV The shell sets BASH_ARGV only when in extended debugging mode see the description of the extdebug option to the shopt builtin below Setting extdebug after the shell has started to execute a script or referencing this variable when extdebug is not set may result in inconsistent values BASH_ARGV0 When referenced this variable expands to the name of the shell or

which the shell looks for dynamically loadable builtins specified by the enable command BASH_REMATCH An array variable whose members are assigned by the = binary operator to the conditional command The element with index 0 is the portion of the string matching the entire regular expression The element with index n is the portion of the string matching the nth parenthesized subexpression BASH_SOURCE An array variable whose members are the source filenames where the corresponding shell function names in the FUNCNAME array variable are defined The shell function FUNCNAME i is defined in the file BASH_SOURCE i and called from BASH_SOURCE i+1 BASH_SUBSHELL Incremented by one within each subshell or subshell environment when the shell begins executing in that environment The initial value is 0 If BASH_SUBSHELL is unset it loses its special properties even if it is subsequently reset BASH_VERSINFO A readonly array variable whose members hold version information for this instance of bash The values assigned to the array members are as follows BASH_VERSINFO 0 The major version number the release BASH_VERSINFO 1 The minor version number the version BASH_VERSINFO 2 The patch level BASH_VERSINFO 3 The build version BASH_VERSINFO 4 The release status e g beta1 BASH_VERSINFO 5 The value of MACHTYPE BASH_VERSION Expands to a string describing the version of this instance of bash COMP_CWORD An index into COMP_WORDS of the word containing the current cursor position This variable is available only in shell functions invoked by the programmable completion facilities see Programmable Completion below COMP_KEY The key or final key of a key sequence used to invoke the current completion function COMP_LINE The current command line This variable is available only in shell functions and external commands invoked by the programmable completion facilities see Programmable Completion below COMP_POINT The index of the current cursor position relative to the beginning of the current command If the current cursor position is at the end of the current command the value of this variable is equal to COMP_LINE This variable is available only in shell functions and external commands invoked by the programmable completion facilities see Programmable Completion below COMP_TYPE Set to an integer value corresponding to the type of completion attempted that caused a completion function to be called TAB for normal completion for listing completions after successive tabs for listing alternatives on partial word completion to list completions if the word is not unmodified or for menu completion This variable is available only in shell functions and external commands invoked by the programmable completion facilities see Programmable Completion below COMP_WORDBREAKS The set of characters that the readline library treats as word separators when performing word completion If COMP_WORDBREAKS is unset it loses its special properties even if it is subsequently reset COMP_WORDS An array variable see Arrays below consisting of the individual words in the current command line The line is split into words as readline would split it using COMP_WORDBREAKS as described above This variable is available only in shell functions invoked by the programmable completion facilities see Programmable Completion below COPROC An array variable see Arrays below created to hold the file descriptors for output from and input to an unnamed coprocess see Coprocesses above DIRSTACK An array variable see Arrays below containing the current contents of
